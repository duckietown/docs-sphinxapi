Welcome to the Duckietown ROS API documentation!
================================================

Here you can find detailed description of the ROS nodes running in the demos implemented in the `daffy` version of the Duckietown codebase. These are organized by repository (hence also by Docker image). You can use the navigation on the side to find the documentation of the various nodes.

The documentation hosted here is automatically generated from the docstrings in the actual code. Therefore, if you spot a mistake or have an improvement suggestion, feel free to make a pull-request in the respective GitHub repository or to reach out to us on Slack. We appreciate all feedback!

Enjoy your time using Duckietown!
